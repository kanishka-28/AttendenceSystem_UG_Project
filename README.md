# üë• Attendo
#### Attendo is an attendance system works on the principle of face - recognition built under Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program 2022.


# Approach Towards Building the Project
### Development Methodology - Scrum Methodology
**Agile Scrum Methodology** is basically incremental development i.e. we build the product in iterations, step by step. <br><br>
We work in ‚ÄúSprints‚Äù where each sprint lasts for a week or two, and focus on building the important features first and then improve the product to make it more potential.

### Here are the sprints I had set for myself for the 4 week journey üòÑ

#### WEEK 0 ( INITIAL DAYS )
1. **Learning** more about Backend Development
2. **Researching** about different api for detecting faces
3. **Deciding the Tech Stack** and finding suitable resources
4. **Designing** my product (using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) )

#### WEEK 1 ( BUILD PHASE )
1. Started with developing the **HomePage** and adjusting the camera position.
2. Developed the **Login** interface for both admins and normal user.
3. Developed the **Flask** backend part for recognizing the **face** and give back its **details(Encodings)**
4. Started working on the **Node** for developing auth.
<br>

**ISSUES :**
Recognizing Faces in real time **( not implemented as of now, But sure of doing it in near future )**


#### WEEK 2 ( BUILD PHASE )
1. Working on the **Authentication** 
2. Working on making the site **responsive**
3. Working on UI/UX and improving its functionality
<br>


#### WEEK 3 ( Winding Up)
1. Deploying
2. Completing integration of backend and frontend services
3. Taking feedback from mentors and other users
<br>

## Before You Begin
Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble my engage project:
* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](http://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.
* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) guide for general express topics. You can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.

## Downloading the Engage - Project
There are several ways you can get the Engage - Project boilerplate:

### Cloning The GitHub Repository
The recommended way to get the Engage - Project is to use git to directly clone the Engae - Project repository:

1. Fork the repository to your own account.
2. Run the following command in the terminal to clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<Your-Github-Name >/Engage-Project.git 
```


### Downloading The Repository Zip File
Another way to use the Engage - Project boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the [main branch on GitHub](https://github.com/Devansh-gaur-1611/Engage-Project) and click on the Code button and then click on Download ZIP



# Get Started
Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to run my Engage - project



## Get started with Frontend

- Open the Frontend folder (Engage Project/frontend/face-recognition) and open the folder in VS Code.

- Open a new terminal by clicking the command (Ctrl + Shift + `) or clicking on  Terminal : New Terminal in the nav-menu

- To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:
    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```

- Create a .env file in the current directory of the project using the touch command in your terminal
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

- Get the .env variables name from the .env.example file and paste them in .env file

- To get the backend urls, we have to first start our backend and then just paste their localhost URL as shown below

    ```bash
    REACT_APP_NODE_API_URL = <Your localhost node url>
    REACT_APP_FLASK_API_URL = <Your localhost flask url>
    ```

- To get the firebase credentials, go to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), create your account, create a new project. Here, you can get your firebase credentials. Also, start the storage functionality of Firebase. Make sure to start in development mode(while starting the Firebase Storage).

## Future Enhancements planned for my Engage Project

### - Take constant feedbacks and suggestions from friends and family

### - Try to refine the features from ***"Improvement"*** point of view
1. *Marking attandance with the help of dept/team code instead of name*
2. *Participants can join the class using team-code*
3. *Add functionality of marking attendance based on IP address and locatiom*

### - Work on implementing the features planned earlier
1. *Making the face - recognition dynamic (i.e. can mark attendance as soon as it detect a face)*
2. *Mark attandance of more than one person at a time*
3. *Sending default password to the participant by mail*
